The assignment was very enjoyable, and I learnt more java syntax whilst completing it. It was a lot of work for me since I'm still learning java syntax, but it also provided an excellent way for me to learn Java. i think the assignment objectives were fulfilled in that I gained familiarity with class calls and interactions, arrays,sets, loops and strings.
